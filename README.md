# PayPal API
Classes for interacting with the PayPal API.

I made this package because PayPal does not provide a complete solution for doing this and their docs are sorely lacking in quality.

## Installation
Install the package with NPM:

```
npm install @lorenstuff/paypal-api
```

## Documentation
To use the package, simply import the `PayPalClient` class and create an instance of it with your PayPal Client ID and Secret. You will also need to specify whether the credentials are for sandbox mode or live mode:

```ts
import { PayPalClient } from "@lorenstuff/paypal-api";

const payPalClient = new PayPalClient(
	{
		sandbox: true,
		clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
		secret: "YOUR_SECRET_HERE",
	});
```

Once you have an instance of the class, you can use it to instantiate clients for various PayPal APIs such as the Orders API or the Webhooks Management API:
```ts
import { PayPalOrdersClient } from "@lorenstuff/paypal-api";

const payPalOrdersClient = new PayPalOrdersClient(
	{
		payPalClient,
	});

// call stuff on payPalOrdersClient such as createOrder or showOrderDetails
```

Each client implements at least part of its respective API. API coverage information can be found in the next section.

## API Coverage
Currently, this library only covers portions of PayPal's API.
