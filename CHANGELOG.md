# Changelog
## 1.0.1
???

## 1.0.0
Completely rewrote the library with full type coverage for the Orders and Webhooks Management APIs, as well as a fully implemented PayPalOrdersClient class.

## 0.2.2
Removed eslint and related packages.

## 0.2.1
Forgot to export those types, woops.

## 0.2.0
Added some Payment related types.

There is no new functionality related to these... yet.

## 0.1.10

* Removed the dependency on the `crc-32` package as it's no longer used by `verifyWebhookSignature`.
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Replaced `verifyWebhookSignature` with ANOTHER new function.
	* This one should actually work as expected this time.
	* This works around issues in PayPal.

## 0.1.9

* Added a dependency on the `crc-32` package as it's now used by `verifyWebhookSignature`.
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Replaced `verifyWebhookSignature` with a new function since the old one somehow didn't work.
	* PayPal's docs on this are VERY bad.
	* This new version is based on a StackOverflow answer converted to TypeScript.
	* May God help us all.

## 0.1.8

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Changed `verifyWebhookSignature` to return the actual response instead of a boolean.

## 0.1.7

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Added new `paypal_request_id` argument to `createOrder`.

## 0.1.6
Adding `"type": "module"` to package.json.

## 0.1.5
Fixed a mistake where the `application_context` property on a `PayPalCreateOrderRequest` was not optional.

## 0.1.4

* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Renamed `PayPalPayPalPaymentObject` to `PayPalWalletResponse`.
	* This is a better name that I did not notice on PayPal's confusing, badly laid out documentation.
	* Also fixed a mistake where the properties of this object were not optional.
* Fixed a mistake where the properties of a `PayPalWallet` were not optional.

## 0.1.3

* Fixed a mistake where the `payment_source` property on a `PayPalOrder` was not optional.
* Fixed a mistake where the properties of a `PayPalPaymentSource` were not optional.

## 0.1.2
Adding exports I forgot for `Orders` and `WebhooksManagement` types.

## 0.1.1
Added build scripts that actually compile the TypeScript to JavaScript before publishing.

(This is, as a result, the first version that actually contains code.)

## 0.1.0
Initial version.
